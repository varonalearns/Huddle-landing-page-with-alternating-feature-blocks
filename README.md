## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Something that I want to work on in the future is to be more thoughtful of when I use classes and ids. I definitely need to be more mindful of how I build websites and building the foundations so that later on in the project, it is not as difficult to switch gears. Something I definitely want to continue to develop.
